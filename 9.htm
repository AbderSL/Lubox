these systems are prepared to detect this kind of activity.&nbsp;This is why,
this implies a ban of the user who tries with the aim of protecting the

they violate the terms of use.&nbsp;WhatsApp, for example, is surely the most
popular of services, the use of MOD of the genre WhatsApp Plus or GBWhatsApp is
not too well seen by WhatsApp, Inc. It is also true that for a few years the
policy of brand has relaxed a little but it should not be overlooked that in
the future there may again be mass expulsions of users who use MODs instead of
the official app.</span></p>
