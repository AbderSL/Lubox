color:#555555'>Lulubox&nbsp;<b>is an application which is used to patch and
fake games</b>&nbsp;in the same way as other similar tools which have existed
in the market for a longer time such as Lucky Patcher, Cheat Engine,
GameGuardian or SB Game Hacker.&nbsp;It has its own catalog of patches that the
user can download and apply to the games he has installed, compatible and included
in the application.&nbsp;With it, the user can obtain a better gaming
experience by modifying different aspects of the games such as speed, number of
lives available, number of coins, score, benefits in the inventory of game
objectsâ€¦ at the same time, the user can generate their own patches and in this
way create the so-called&nbsp;<i>MOD APK</i>&nbsp;games that he installed and
then distribute them.</span></p>

does not appear on Google Play and it is related to the ethics of its
use.&nbsp;Consider that some of its features are related to skipping in-app
purchases, and in many cases it is the only way that developers have to
monetize their work to have income at the end of the month.&nbsp;If you choose
to rig the game for not paying, what you do is equivalent to hacking the
application.</span></p>
