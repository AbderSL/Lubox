color:#555555'>Lulubox&nbsp;<b>is an application which is used to patch and
fake games</b>&nbsp;in the same way as other similar tools which have existed
in the market for a longer time such as Lucky Patcher, Cheat Engine,
GameGuardian or SB Game Hacker.&nbsp;It has its own catalog of patches that the
user can download and apply to the games he has installed, compatible and included
in the application.&nbsp;With it, the user can obtain a better gaming
experience by modifying different aspects of the games such as speed, number of
lives available, number of coins, score, benefits in the inventory of game
objects… at the same time, the user can generate their own patches and in this
way create the so-called&nbsp;<i>MOD APK</i>&nbsp;games that he installed and
then distribute them.</span></p>

does not appear on Google Play and it is related to the ethics of its
use.&nbsp;Consider that some of its features are related to skipping in-app
purchases, and in many cases it is the only way that developers have to
monetize their work to have income at the end of the month.&nbsp;If you choose
to rig the game for not paying, what you do is equivalent to hacking the
application.</span></p>
